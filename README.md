Visualizing Data Sets
=============

A project for IS217 for [NJIT](http://njit.edu/). Visualizing state spending in 3D.

### Data Sets
Data is provided by <http://usgovernmentspending.com/>. We parse that data and convert it to JSON for ease of use with three.js.

There are three columns associated with the data sets:
- State Spending
- 'guesstimated' or 'out-year estimate' for State Spending
- Local Spending
- 'guesstimated' or 'out-year estimate' for Local Spending
- State and Local Spending
- 'guesstimated' or 'out-year estimate' for Local & State Spending
